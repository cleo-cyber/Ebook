                        <p>Have an AGM/Harambee coming up? Want to remind parents to complete the fee payment? Important announcement? No longer rely on students to deliver this information as it can get distorted or not delivered at all.</p>
                        <p>We understand that one of the major struggles in most schools is ensuring efficient communication. Some parents have missed AGM meetings, failed to pay fees or even fail show up during on opening/closing day due to a pro`blem in communication. With our system, you can communicate via both email and SMS to all parents, students or staff, at the same time, with the click of a button.</p>
